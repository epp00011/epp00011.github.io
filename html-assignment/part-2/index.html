    <h2>About Me</h2>    
        <p>I am a new student to <em>Algonquin College</em>. I have just graduated from Lester B. Pearson High School. During my time there I got into the media arts styled programs such as photography. This was very enjoyable for me and decided to take the Interactive Media Design program. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program.</p>
