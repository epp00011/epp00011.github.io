        <h2>About Me</h2>    
        <p>I am a new student to <em>Algonquin College</em>. I have just graduated from Lester B. Pearson High School. During my time there I got into the media arts styled programs such as photography. This was very enjoyable for me and decided to take the Interactive Media Design program.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy spending time with my friends as well as my two pets, a dog and a cat. I also like taking photos of my pets, food and almost anything.</p>
